Hi, I’m Anna

I am a project manager with passion for the data and design. If for whatever reason I can't go out to the mountains or take a ride with my motorbike - you'll find me by my laptop  learning how to analyze something (yes, I am fun that way).

I’m currently learning bash, awk and python and this is my place for storing some examples of my codes.

Cheers!
