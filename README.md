Code is based on work activities. The goal is to check thousands of lines of data, which is assumed to be incorrect as it was maintained manually for years. Main tasks are:

re-validate statuses of the items in use in production based on their procurement dates that define further action plans re-validate statuses also based on the versions of the produced items, as sometimes there are same types and different versions present in stock and only latest ones should be used for new installations, older ones may only be used as spare parts.
